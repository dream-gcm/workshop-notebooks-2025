    "# Tutorial  to install a ready-to-use environment to run the DREAM model ONLINE via BINDER\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** \n",
    "__This tutorial provides  instructions to install a ready-to-use environment to run the DREAM model__. This environment (including fortran compiler, netcdf libraries, python  and all what you need) is provided throught a Docker container that you will run online via Binder. Note that the Docke/Binder image is in open acces but  does not contain the model code itself, that we will  download from the DREAM github (_authorized members only_ - if you're not yet part of the group, please contact us). \n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that running the model ON-LINE via BINDER makes it more tricky to save your own results than if running in the a Docker container on your local laptop. More useful to use for a quick demo to someone or if you don't need to save outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "**Prerequisites:** \n",
    "  * You'll need to know your github identifiers\n",
    "  * You'll need  to be a member of the dream-gcm github organization (if not a member aleady, send us your github login so that we can  add you in the group)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions to launch via Binder:** \n",
    "* In a web browser go to:\n",

    "(Might take several minutes to open. In the end youâ€™ll land on a Jupyter lab session as with the local Docker container)\n",
    "\n",
    "--> That's it! \n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions to run the model:**\n",
    "* In the jupyterlab via Binder, open a terminal.\n",
    "* Then in the terminal do:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    # clone the model code\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/dream-gcm/DREAM.git\n",
    "    cd DREAM\n",
    "    git checkout dev-in-Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "    # recompile libraries\n",
    "\tcd dream_model/source/lib\n",
    "\t./makelib_docker.csh\n",

    "    # run the diagnostics \n",
    "\tcd ../diagnostics\n",
    "\t./run_output.sh EX2 \n",
    "```\n",
    "* Then double click on the EX2 notebook and run it.\n",
