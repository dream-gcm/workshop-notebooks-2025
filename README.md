#### How to:
* You can either install Docker on your laptop and get a read-to-use environment to run the DREAM model following the [tutorial  here](2025-07-15_Getting-started-with-Docker.ipynb).

* Alternatively you can  also try to run it on-line via Binder (no installation required - but beware it takes a while to load the page)
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dream-gcm/workshop-notebooks-2025/main?urlpath=lab)

* In any case, don't forget that the [DREAM user manual](https://dreamusermanual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is also available for more indepth understanding of everythin about DREAM!

* Beware that to get the model code you'll need to ask us to be added to the GitHub list of DREAM users (as the code is in a private repository). Contact us!
