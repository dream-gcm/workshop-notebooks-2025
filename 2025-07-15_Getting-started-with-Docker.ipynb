    "## How to install a ready-to-use environment for the DREAM model in a DOCKER container on your local machine\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** \n",
    "__This tutorial provides  instructions to install a ready-to-use environment to run the DREAM model__. This environment (including fortran compiler, netcdf libraries, python  and all what you need) is provided throught a Docker container that you will run on your own machine. Note that the Docker image is in open acces but  does not contain the model code itself, that we will  download from the DREAM github (_authorized members only_ - if you're not yet part of the group, please contact us). \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial takes you step-by-step to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Download the Docker Desktop app and install it,\n",
    "  * Download the Docker image that provides a ready-to-use environment for the DREAM model,\n",
    "  * Run the Docker container on your laptop,\n",
    "  * Within the Docker container, download the DREAM model code, tools and notebooks needed for this workshop.\n",

    "  * You'll need  to be a member of the dream-gcm GitHub organization to download the DREAM model code (**if not a member aleady, send us your github login** so that we can  add you in the group. If you don't have a GitHub login yet, it is not too late, some help [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github).\n",
    "  * You'll need to know your github identifiers (and to have a personal token at hand to be able to clone the private repository of the DREAM code. If you don't know if you have a personal token yet, here is a [cheat sheet to generate one](https://chatgpt.com/share/6870d610-49cc-800c-b047-1f5099b1b3b0)). Don't worry, we will try to help those of you who are beginners with GitHub if you need.\n",
    "  * You'll need to be ROOT on your computer to be able to install the Docker Desktop app (instructions below), OR ELSE you'll need to already have Docker installed on your machine before coming to the workshop.\n",

    "> In this command, we tell Docker to run the Docker image “dreamgcm-env” from the GitHub website `ghcr.io/dream-gcm/dreamgcm-env` and inside the Docker,  run the JupyterLab  and   link port 8888 to the port inside the image to display the Jupyterlab. **Importantly** we also link  your local workshop directory on your machine (`your-local-path-to-MY-DREAM-WORKSHOP/`) to the virtual directory `/home/jovyan/work/` in the Docker image. Once in the Docker, you will work in `/home/jovyan/work/` but your actions will happen and remain in `your-local-path-to-MY-DREAM-WORKSHOP/` even after you close the Docker session.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  c. Copy the link displayed in the terminal that starts with  http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=…….  (copy the entire token with all the numbers)\n",
