    "__Summary:__ This is the “hello world” of running DREAM. The point here is just to see the code running for the first time:  we initialise with a state of rest and add no forcing. When running the model, some output is printed  in the terminal  every 16 time steps (6 hours) in the form of the 100th spectral coefficient of vorticity, a complex variable. The choice of z(100) is arbitrary. Since in this case the initial condition is at rest, the value of z(100) will be very small. Following its value is just a quick check as to how the model is behaving. \n",
